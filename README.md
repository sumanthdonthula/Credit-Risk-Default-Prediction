# Credit-Risk-Default-Prediction

🚀 Hey there! Just wanted to share something cool I've been up to lately. 😎

📂 **Dataset:** I've been digging into some interesting data over at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Check it out here: [UCI Credit Card Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients).

🤖 **Models Created:** I've been playing around with three models:

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Random Forest**
3. **XGBoost**

📈📊 **Performance:** While all the models did their thing, XGBoost turned out to be the real champ, delivering some impressive results.

🧮 **Parameter Tweaking:** I've fine-tuned XGBoost's settings to keep the good times rolling.

📦 **Data Magic:** I've also made sure our data is in tip-top shape. We've got a handy scaler to standardize new data.

🌐 **Streamlit Site:** Now, for the fun part – I've put together a user-friendly Streamlit website. You can make API calls and predict credit card defaults with ease.

This project is all about using data to make life easier and smarter. Super excited to see how it can help folks make better financial choices. 🚀🔮💼

If you're curious to see how it all works or just want to chat, hit me up or swing by my Streamlit site! 🌐🔗📈 #MachineLearning #CreditCardPrediction #DataScience #AI #UCI #XGBoost
