# Credit-Risk-Default-Prediction

🚀 Hey there! Just wanted to share something cool I've been up to lately. 😎

📂 **Dataset:** I've been digging into some interesting data over at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Check it out here: [UCI Credit Card Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients).

🤖 **Models Created:** I've been playing around with three models:

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Random Forest**
3. **XGBoost**

📈📊 **Performance:** While all the models did their thing, XGBoost turned out to be the real champ, delivering some impressive results.

🧮 **Parameter Tweaking:** I've fine-tuned XGBoost's settings to keep the good times rolling.

📦 **Data Magic:** I've also made sure our data is in tip-top shape. We've got a handy scaler to standardize new data.

🌐 **Streamlit Site:** Now, for the fun part – I've put together a user-friendly Streamlit website. You can make API calls and predict credit card defaults with ease.

Super excited to see how it can help folks make better financial choices. 🚀🔮💼
